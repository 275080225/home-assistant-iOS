Summer is over, school is back in session, that means it's well past time for a big Home Assistant for iOS update! We are back on track and working on pumping out new features and squashing bugs once more. Apologies for the lull there in the summer.

Here's what's new in this version:

- iPhone X compatibility (IMHO HA looks super slick on it)
- Default camera category attachment content-type to JPEG
- Status bar color changes with frontend theme color
- Support landscape orientation
- Improved permission dialogs
- Improve API communication with Home Assistant
- Change chat support link from Gitter to Discord
- Add the version string to the about page
- Our first translation: German!
- Improve location management
- Swift 4
- Removed a bunch of stale code and dependencies
- Removed native UI. It's web view only from here on out since Home Assistant adds new components/platforms too frequently for native UI to keep up
- Lots of web view improvements around sizing/layout and logic
- Status bar improvements for landscape and sizing issues

Don't forget to leave an updated review as iOS 11 resets reviews with every new version. Thanks!
