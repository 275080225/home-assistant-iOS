New Features:

  - Add a reset function to clear out credentials and device ID, resetting the app to its fresh state
  - Add background fetch so battery updates even more frequently than before
  - Add a new notification for background fetch
  - Initial iBeacon support. Note: Need some features added to Home Assistant for this, expect this to be activated this weekend w/ 0.45.0
  - Add location update via background fetch notification
  - Camera notification content extension supports play/pause controls
  - Map is no longer a static image which makes it look much better
  - Map supports multiple pins. Look for updated docs in the next day or two describing how to do this
  - Map supports customization of features via the push payload

Fixes:

  - Notification actions didn't work if activationMode was set to background and app had been terminated
  - Significant Location Updates correctly send a notification (if you have that enabled)
  - Significant Location Updates didn't work after app termination
  - Fix weblinks so they open in external browser
  - General Settings is now correctly hidden if you don't have Chrome installed and shown if you do
  - Open in Chrome preference was continually being overwritten at app launch
  - Send location during background fetch only if location is enabled, otherwise just update device state (i.e. battery)
  - Web view contents aren't cut off at the bottom anymore

Misc:

  - Disable entity picture downloading for now, should speed up startup and most operations
  - Continue localization work. German is coming up this week, French shortly thereafter!
  - Changed to a new icon
  - Add a space to the display name so notifications look better at the expense of a truncated homescreen name
  - Status bar is now Home Assistant blue
  - Set color of toolbar items to Home Assistant blue
  - Remove old dependencies to cut down app size
